    <h1>About Tiny Messy Hands</h1>
    <p>Tiny Messy Hands is a local playgroup focused on providing fun, stimulating messy play sessions for children aged 0–5 years. Each session is packed with sensory-rich, hands-on activities that encourage creativity, exploration, and early childhood development.</p>
    <p>Our play experiences are carefully themed and designed to support learning through play. Parents and caregivers attend alongside their children, helping to create a warm, inclusive, and supportive environment where everyone is welcome—and a little mess is celebrated.</p>
